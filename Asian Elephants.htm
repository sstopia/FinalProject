   <p style="color:#052684;font-size:200%;font-family:Aharoni;">
       The largest land mammal on earth, the African elephant weighs up to eight tons. The elephant is distinguished by its massive body, large ears and a long trunk, which has many uses ranging from using it as a hand to pick up objects, as a horn to trumpet warnings, an arm raised in greeting to a hose for drinking water or bathing.

Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives. They are much smaller in size and their ears are straight at the bottom, unlike the large fan-shape ears of the African species. Only some Asian male elephants have tusks. All African elephants, including females, have tusks. Elephants are either left or right-tusked and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. The Asian elephant has four toes on the hind foot and five on the forefoot, while the African elephant has three on the hind foot and five on the forefoot.
       <p style="color:black;font-size:200%;font-family:Comic Sans MS ;text-align:center">Why Asian Elephants are becoming extinct?</p>   
    
<p style="color:#052684;font-size:150%;font-family:Comic Sans MS ;">They also have much smaller tusks. The largest threats to the Asian elephant are poaching and habitat loss. Their tusks are worth a lot of money on the black market, so large-tusked males are in constant danger of being poached. Elephants are also captured alive for domestic use, such as tourist attractions.

    <h2>In Danger of Extinction:</h2>
<p style="color:#052684;font-size:150%;font-family:Comic Sans MS ;">
     In Asia, it is estimated that less than 50,000 elephants remain; more than half of them in India. Tiny populations, a few hundreds or thousands, cling on in countries across south-east Asia and the Himalayas.

In Africa, the larger of the two species is a step further from extinction. Less than half a million roam the continent, mostly in the southern states. In the west and the forested centre, elephants are in a particularly perilous condition.Around 20,000 African elephants were killed last year for their tusks, more than were born. Chinese wealth is financing a hunger for ivory that threatens to bring an end to wild elephants within our lifetime.

There has never been a more dangerous time to be an elephant. Not during the industrial pillaging of the colonial era, nor the chaotic African and Asian independence movements that sparked a 1970s poaching boom, has an elephant been more likely to fall to a gun.

In spite of the global ban on international trade (overseen by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species – Cites) the illegal ivory trade has exploded. Some believe large amounts of ivory has also been bought and stored in secret warehouses by investors needing somewhere to hide money from the global downturn. Criminal gangs bribe officials to ship huge quantities of ivory through the ports to illicit factories and markets of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand in particular. In 2011, seizures hit a peak of 23 metric tonnes – 2,500 elephants. But that is only a fraction of what makes it through undisturbed.
