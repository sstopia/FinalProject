<p style="color:#696969;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;">The primary threats to the survival of Siberian tigers are poaching and habitat loss from intensive logging and development. The Siberian Tiger is classified as endangered by the IUCN. South China tigers (Panthera tigris amoyensis) are the smallest of all the tiger subspecies; it is also the most critically endangered.</p>
    
<p style="color:black;font-size:150%;font-family:Comic Sans MS ;">What causes tigers to be endangered ?</p> 
    <p style="color:#696969;font-size:150%;font-family:Abadi MT Condensed Light;"> 
The main reasons tigers are endangered—in most cases cases, critically endangered—are illegal hunting for their pelts, meat and body parts (used in folk medicines) as well as habitat loss that results from logging and other forms of forest destruction.    
    
<p style="color:black;font-size:150%;font-family:Comic Sans MS;">How many Tigers are left in 2018 ?</p> 
    <p style="color:#696969;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;">         
The latest data is from 2016 and estimates around 3,900 tigers in the wild. The US captive population of tigers exceeds 5,000.</p>

     Behavior.</h1> <p style="color:#696969;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;"> Tigers occupy a variety of habitats from tropical forests, evergreen forests, woodlands and mangrove swamps to grasslands, savannah and rocky country. They are mostly nocturnal (more active at night) and are ambush predators that rely on the camouflage their stripes provide.  </p>

    <p style="color:#111;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;"> REMAINING TIGER SUBSPECIES:
     <p><a title="Bengal tigers" href="bengal.htm"><p style="color:#111;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;">Bengal Tigers</p> <p style="color:#111;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;">(Panthera tigris tigris) are the most numerous tiger subspecies with its remaining wild populations estimated at around 2,500. The Bengal tiger roams a wide range of habitats including high altitudes, tropical and subtropical rainforests, mangroves, and grasslands. They are primarily found in parts of India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Bengal tigers are sometimes called Indian tigers and account for over half of all tigers remaining in the wild. Poaching for tiger parts is their major threat. The Bengal tiger is classified as endangered by the IUCN.

     
 <p><a title="Bengal tigers" href="indoni.htm"><p style="color:#111;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;">
     Indochinese tigers</p> <p style="color:#111;font-size:150%;font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light;">(Panthera tigris corbetti) are located in Thailand, Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam. The population of this subspecies had fallen by more than 70 percent in slightly more than a decade, and the total population of Indochinese tigers is estimated at fewer than 300 individuals. However, due to restricted access to areas where the Indochinese tiger lives, little is known about their population status. Human development, such as road construction is fragmenting habitats. And decades of poaching has also contributed to their rapid decline. The Indochinese tiger is classified as endangered by the IUCN.</p>
